# STM32F407G-DISC1 Bare-Metal Blink Project (VS Code)

This project provides a minimal bare-metal template for the STM32F407G-DISC1 (STM32F4-DISCO) board, using arm-none-eabi-gcc, OpenOCD, and VS Code with Cortex-Debug. It is designed for register-level development (no HAL, no CubeMX) and supports reliable build, flash, and debug workflows.

```

## Prerequisites
- **VS Code** (latest recommended)
- **Cortex-Debug extension** (for debugging)
- **arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain** (compiler, linker, objcopy, size)
- **OpenOCD** (for flashing/debugging)
- **ST-Link USB drivers** (for STM32F4-DISCO)

## Installation & Setup
1. **Install VS Code**
   - Download and install from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. **Install Cortex-Debug Extension**
   - In VS Code, go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Search for `Cortex-Debug` and install

3. **Install arm-none-eabi-gcc Toolchain**
   - Download from [Arm Developer](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm)
   - Add toolchain binaries to your system PATH

4. **Install OpenOCD**
   - Download from [https://openocd.org/](https://openocd.org/)
   - Add OpenOCD to your system PATH

5. **Install ST-Link USB Drivers**
   - Download from STMicroelectronics [STSW-LINK009](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html)

6. **Clone or Copy Project Folder**
   - Place the project folder anywhere on your system

## Building the Project
- Open a terminal in the project folder where the Makefile is
- Run:
  ```
  make
  ```
- Output files (`main.elf`, `main.bin`, `main.hex`, `main.map`) will be generated in the project root

## Flashing the Board
- Connect the STM32F4-DISCO board via USB (ST-Link)
- Run:
  ```
  make flash
  ```
- This uses OpenOCD to program the board with `main.elf`

## Debugging in VS Code
1. **Configure Debugger**
   - Ensure `.vscode/launch.json` is present and set for Cortex-Debug with OpenOCD and ST-Link
   - Example config is provided in the project

2. **Start Debugging**
   - Press `F5` or click `Run and Debug` in VS Code
   - Set breakpoints, watch variables, step through code

## Customization
- Edit source files in `src/` and headers in `inc/` as needed for your application
- The project is generic for STM32F407G-DISC1, but can be adapted for other STM32F4 devices by updating headers and linker script

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing separator error in Makefile:** Ensure all command lines are indented with tabs, not spaces
- **Toolchain not found:** Add arm-none-eabi-gcc and OpenOCD to your system PATH
- **Debugging issues:** Confirm ST-Link drivers are installed and board is connected
- **Breakpoints not working:** Ensure debug info (`-g` flag) is enabled in Makefile and startup code is correct
